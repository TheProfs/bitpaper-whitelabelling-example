Bitpaper Whitelabel Example

## Run

Clone this repository

## Install

Make sure you have the latest [NodeJS][nodejs] installed, `$ cd` into the cloned folder,
then:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Run server
$ npm start
```

then visit `http://localhost:5099`

## How it works

Upon visiting `http://localhost:5099`, the `index.html` file is served which
has an `iframe` pointing to a created API paper.

The paper is displayed under the domain `http://localhost:5099` instead
of `https://bitpaper.io/go/Maths/xDx1001`
